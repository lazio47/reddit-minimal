# Minimal Reddit
Live view: [Here](https://reddit-lazio.netlify.app/)

## Description

This project is a minimal functional Reddit application using React, Typescript and Redux. Reddit is a well-known platform where users share links to articles, media, and various web content. By leveraging the Reddit API, this application fetches real-time data, allowing users to view and search posts and comments directly from Reddit. This project not only demonstrates the ability to integrate external APIs but also showcases skills in managing application state with Redux and building interactive, responsive user interfaces with React. There is use of local storage to handle the limited number of API calls.
